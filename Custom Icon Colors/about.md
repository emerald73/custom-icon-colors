# Custom Icon Colors

~~Because nobody else made one (I think)~~
Turns out QOLMod by TheSillyDoggo already has a similar feature but IDC I still think it's pretty neat

Allows you to set your P1 color, P2 color, and glow color to any color you want.

Does NOT work with several other mods which modify icon colors, which are listed as incompatibilities in mod.json
